# AI Test Scenarios - Sia Moon Property Management

This document outlines comprehensive test scenarios for the AI COO and AI CFO agents in the Sia Moon Property Management system. All tests run in **simulation mode** to ensure no real-world impact.

## üß™ Overview

The AI simulation system provides safe testing of AI agents without affecting real data, staff assignments, or financial records. All tests are designed to validate AI decision-making logic, confidence scoring, and escalation triggers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements

- **Simulation Mode**: `SIMULATION_MODE = true` must be active
- **No Real Impact**: AI agents must not assign real staff or affect real data
- **Logging**: All actions logged to `/api/ai-log` with `simulate: true` flag
- **Safety**: Tests can be run repeatedly without consequences

The AI COO (Chief Operating Officer) handles booking requests, staff assignments, and operational decisions.

### Test Case 1: Standard Cleaning Booking
