## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details:**

### **Firebase Integration:**
- **Authentication:** Staff login using Firebase Auth
- **Database:** Real-time Firestore listeners for job assignments
- **Storage:** Photo uploads to Firebase Storage in `job-completions/` folder
- **Security:** Staff can only access jobs assigned to their UID

### **Real-time Data Flow:**
1. **Webapp creates job** → Firestore `jobs` collection
2. **Mobile app receives update** → Real-time Firestore listener
3. **Push notification sent** → Expo Notifications
4. **Staff accepts/declines** → Firestore update with `staffResponse`
5. **Job completion** → Photos uploaded, job marked complete

### **UI/UX Features:**
- **Dark theme** consistent with webapp branding
- **Material Design** using React Native Paper
- **Responsive layout** for different screen sizes
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **Offline-ready** architecture

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions:**
